# Some Express/Webapp boilerplate

This repository is a small set of functions to help setting up simple
webapps/Express services.

It's made of two parts: one that help setting up Express quickly, and one that
provide Grunt tasks to transpile a webapp so it can work in most browsers.

These tools allows some level of configuration, but most default options expects
a specific directory layout for your project.

## Managing dependencies

This project does not "really" depend on anything, since all parts are
optional. However, some dependencies are required for things to work.

Instead of forcing all optional dependencies to come with, I decided to
document here what is required, and for what. It's up to the calling project to
have the proper dependencies.
(this will also avoid dependency version nightmares).

For webapp building:

- babel-loader
- eslint-loader
- @babel/core
- @babel/preset-env
- @babel/preset-react
- @babel-plugin-transform-define
- core-js
- grunt-contrib-imagemin
- grunt-contrib-pug
- grunt-contrib-copy
- grunt-contrib-watch
- grunt-sass
- node-sass
- grunt-webpack
- grunt
- esm

For express:

- express
- winston
- express-winston

## Webapp side

There's a set of functions that provide Grunt tasks for the following:

- Parsing pug templates
- Compress images
- Using webpack to transpile JavaScript
- Compile SASS stylesheet into CSS
- Copy all files not handled by above tasks

The expected directory layout for this is to put everything related to the
webapp part of your project in a directory names `webres/<targetname>`.
This directory will be called the "webapp" directory in the following sections.
The target name is the name you provide to the `reactApp()` function.

Outputs will be produced in the `dist/<targetname>` directory.
This will be called the "output" directory in the following sections.

This file shows the basic features; for more advanced control you can inspect
options objects in each files from `src/grunt/reactapp`.

## Basic usage

You can call the `reactApp()` function to populate a Grunt configuration with
tasks required for the webapp.

Example in a minimal Gruntfile (meaning, I keep all the task loading and extra
cruft out of this example):

```JavaScript
const {reactApp} = require("@cley_faye/boilerplate/grunt");

module.exports = grunt => {
  const baseGruntConfig = {};
  const reactAppConfig = {
    pug: {},
    image: {},
    webpack: {},
    sass: {},
    copy: {},
  };
  const requiredTasks = reactApp(
    baseGruntConfig,
    "myAppName",
    reactAppConfig
  );
  grunt.initConfig(baseGruntConfig);
  grunt.register(
    "myWebApp",
    "Build the webapp",
    requiredTasks
  );
};
```

This would register a task names "myWebApp", process files in
`webres/myAppName` and output in `dist/myAppName` using most defualt options.
Each different tasks can have his own options, described below.
Each task also have a `disabled` property that can be set to `true`, in which
case it will not generate the corresponding task.

### Pug templates

Any file with the `.pug` suffix in the webapp directory will be processed and
put in the output directory, reproducing the directory structure from the
webapp directory.
The pug options support a `fileSuffix` property, which will affect the output
file names. Defaults to `.html`.
It also supports an `options` property passed as-is to grunt-contrib-pug.
Most notably, `options.data` can be set here to provide data to the templates.

### Image files

All `.jpg`, `.png` and `.svg` files in the webapp directory will be compressed
as best as possible and put in the output directory.

```TODO
Future versions will allow specifying per-image options, so one can keep high
resolution files around and still produce optimal files for web distribution.
```

### Webpack

Take the provided entries (there's a sensible default) and create a bundle for
web distribution.
The default settings apply a set of features: eslint parsing, babel with some
generic settings that targets recent browsers, control over some development
features of webpackâ€¦

The webpack options support a host of properties:

- options: passed as-is to grunt-webpack
- entry: list of entrypoints. Defaults to using a single entrypoint named
  `webres/<targetname>/js/loader.js`.
- externals: record describing external dependencies (dependencies that will
  not be bundled in the bundle). Key are the "require" name, value is the
  variable that will have to exist at runtime.
- output: where to put the bundle. Defaults to
  `dist/<targetname>/js/<targetname>.js`
- loaders: loaders that parse the input files before bundling. Defaults to
  using Babel and eslint. It is possible to keep using these defaults with some
  customizations by using `webpackLoadersDefault()`.
- plugins: webpack plugins to use
- mode: The build mode. "development", "production" or "none"

### SASS

All `.sass` and `.scss` files in the webapp directory will be processed as
`.css` files in the output directory, except for files named `.inc.*`.

### Copy task

It is possible to move other file types into the output directory using the
copy task. Any file not handled by the other tasks will be copied as-is into
the output directory.

JavaScript files are expected to be handled by webpack; if you have a
JavaScript file you want to copy as-is (or any other file excluded by the
default filters), you can provide them as a list in the `extraFiles` property
for that task options.

### Shared settings

The "production" mode setting requires changes among multiple tasks. It is
possible to configure them in one call using `reactAppOptionsHelper()`.

The example from before can become:

```JavaScript
const {
  reactApp,
  reactAppOptionsHelper,
} = require("@cley_faye/boilerplate/grunt");

module.exports = grunt => {
  const baseGruntConfig = {};
  const reactAppConfig = {
    pug: {},
    image: {},
    webpack: {},
    sass: {},
    copy: {},
  };
  const requiredTasks = reactApp(
    baseGruntConfig,
    "myAppName",
    reactAppOptionsHelper(
      {
        production: !!grunt.option("prod"),
      },
      reactAppConfig
    )
  );
  grunt.initConfig(baseGruntConfig);
  grunt.register(
    "myWebApp",
    "Build the webapp",
    requiredTasks
  );
};
```

### Watcher

All files except those parsed by webpack can be watched for updates and
automatically trigger their task when needed.
Simply run `npx grunt watch` to start the watcher.
It is also configured to have a livereload server on port 35729.

Webpack tasks can also be watched by manually running the
`webpack:<target name>_watch` target in another terminal.

## Express application definition

The express helper actually provide a single place to configure most of the
express pipeline with some generic options and generic-ish way to provide
routes.

It is limited to a very simple set of features but avoid having to retype them
all the time.
Some standard security features are not defined here; my personal usecases
usually involves having a secure webserver in front that takes care of most
headers.

Default settings operate using winston for logging.

To define your express app, you can call `createPipeline()`.

Quick sample:

```JavaScript
import express from "express";
import {createPipeline} from "@cley_faye/boilerplate/lib/express";

const app = express();
app.use(createPipeline({
  topLevels: [],
  routes: [],
  statics: [],
  postStatics: [],
  errorHandlers: [],
  options: {
    log: {},
    middleware: {},
    defaultErrorHandler: true,
  }
}));

export default app;
```

This will not serve anything by default, but display most top-level options
that can be provided at this point.

### Options

The log options can be used to control the express server logging behavior.
It supports the following properties:

- route: log all route called. Can be either a boolean or an express-winston
  configuration. In the later case, all properties are accepted except the
  winston instance, which is set separately.
- error: log all errors
- logger: an instance of a winston logger.

The middleware options allow enabling/disabling common middlewares.
Currently only support one option: `json`, to enable auto-parsing of json body.

The `defaultErrorHandler` property enable a final error handler.
It's behavior is to intercept errors/exceptions and return them as a reply.
If the error is a proper error object (from `http-errors`), it will return the
message (if expose is true) and the statusCode.
If the request declares that it can accept json, the error is sent back as a
json object with `statusCode` and `message`.
Otherwise the message is sent as a plaintext reply.

### Defining routes

`topLevels`, `routes` and `postStatics` are arrays of handlers.
Each handler can be either another Router (for route composition), a simple
handler without route specification (a simple `req, res, next` function), or a
complete route definition in the form of an object with the following
properties:

- route: the route to handle
- handler: the route handler (or an array, or a Router)
- method: the method this route should handle. Defaults to "get".

### Defining error handlers

The `errorHandlers` property accept an array of functions that follow the
express "error handler" kind of functions (four parameters: `err`, `req`,
`res` and `next`).
If provided, and if the default error handler is set, they will be called
before it.

### Providing statics

To serve static files, the `statics` property can be used.
It's an array of either directly the path to a directory, in which case it will
be served at the root of the service, or an object with the following
properties:

- root: The directory where the static files are
- options: The options to pass to express static handler
- route: The route under which the static files will be served

## Express application running

Once the express application is defined, it need to be started to serve files
and resources.
A helper is provided to do so, using the `appStart()` function.

```JavaScript
import consoleLogger from "@cley_faye/boilerplate/lib/winston";
import app from "./app";
import {appStart} from "@cley_faye/boilerplate/lib/express";

appStart({
  app,
  allowNonLocal: false,
  port: 3000,
  shutdownFunction: () => {;},
  logger: consoleLogger,
}).then(({port, server}) => {;});
```

The settings are:

- allowNonLocal: listen only to localhost or not
- port: port to listen to. Can be 0 to use a random available port
- shutdownFunction: a function to call after the server stop listening
- logger: a winston logger to log that the server started listening

The function returns a promise that resolve with the actual port used for
listening when the server is started.

The server is automatically registered using the `autoclose` part to stop when
a SIGINT signal is received.
It is also possible to trigger a stop by calling the `closeServer()` function
on `@cley_faye/boilerplate/lib/express/autoclose`.
This feature only supports one server at a time.

## Console logging

For convenience, a winston logger using console as output is provided:

```JavaScript
import consoleLogger from "@cley_faye/boilerplate/lib/winston";

consoleLogger.info("Log line");
```

## Using TypeScript

Typical use of TypeScript implies converting `.ts` file to `.js`.
For a React app using webpack, there's two approach: either instruct webpack to
accept `.ts` files (for example, using `ts-loader`) or have your entry point be
a `.js` file that imports the generated output from TypeScript. Either way,
watch mode will be capable of detecting change in the source material, as long
as the TypeScript compiler is also running.

For Express app, there is no particular things to take care, except that if you
use a facility like `nodemon` you have to watch the TypeScript output instead
of the actual source files.
